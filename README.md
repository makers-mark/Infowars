# Infowars
Roku Channel for Infowars
The censorship regime is onto something, censoring the ones that call them out for their agenda. When you get it, you get it. THINK FOR YOURSELF.

This is the full time Infowars feed. You have to enable developer mode (look it up, it's not hard to do), and sideload this to the roku. It is based off of the boilerplate example from roku developers, with added thumbnails and a URL that has worked for me for over a year as of today (May 7th, 2023). Keep in mind, it just plays and there is no screen timeout or polite reminder to ask you if you are still watching. Save bandwidth if you aren't watching if at all possible.
